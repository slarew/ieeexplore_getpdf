IEEE Xplore getPDF
==================

If you have done any research on the [IEEE Xplore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/) website, you might be familiar with the banner that is displayed at the top of the page when viewing PDF files.  This extension for Safari loads the PDF without the banner at the top of the page.

I access the [IEEE Xplore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/) through a proxy provided by my university.  Thus, this plugin will load on the domains `ieeexplore.ieee.org` (on-campus) and `ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.lib.purdue.edu` (off-campus).

I am still testing the extension at this time.  When I am confident that it works as expected, I will release a signed version for anyone to download and install.  Until then, you may download the source and follow the [Safari Extensions Development Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/) to install the extension.  Note that you will need to be in the [Safari Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/safari/) to obtain a proper signing identity which Safari will accept.
