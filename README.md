IEEE Xplore getPDF
==================

[**Download**](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sglarew/projects/ieeexplore-getpdf/ieeexplore_getpdf.safariextz)

If you have done any research on the [IEEE Xplore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/)
website, you might be familiar with the banner that is displayed at the top of
the page when viewing PDF files.  This extension for Safari loads the PDF
without the banner at the top of the page.

I access [IEEE Xplore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/) through a proxy
provided by my university.  Thus, this plugin will load on the domains
`ieeexplore.ieee.org` (on-campus) and
`ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.lib.purdue.edu` (off-campus).  If you would like the extension to load on other domains, file an [issue](https://github.com/slarew/ieeexplore_getpdf/issues) with the requested domains and I will try to add them to the list.

Download the latest packaged extension [here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sglarew/projects/ieeexplore-getpdf/ieeexplore_getpdf.safariextz).
